    "# Building Foundation Model based Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with LLMs to provide you with advanced reasoning and routing capabilities is easy to get started with. After all the models understand human level instructions, and provide formattable string outputs as a result. \n",
    "\n",
    "Yet, when you are looking to develop production ready applications you will require robust data integrations to provide input to your model, you want to solve the alignment problem with LLMs, tune the behavior to your specific corporate governance and brand messaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex workflows will involve multiple stages to create intermediate results. These stages require the model to switch roles, or might involve optimized task models to be more efficient, or even fine-tuned further on the specific tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of this creates complexity when creating and maintaining your LLM based applications in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using the power of LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently the community unified their efforts on a high-level Framework to ease the development of foundation model based applications.\n",
    "LangChain was developed to ease the integration of models deployed, or used over proprietary APIs. It lets you easily integrate models into your application, manage the templates for prompts to tune your model behaviour, provide IO, add memory and chain multiple reasoning and action steps. "

    "LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "It helps us with:\n",
    "1. **Integration** - Bring external data, such files, databases, webcontent, API data to your application\n",
    "2. **Coordination** - Develop reusable, modularized pipelines to execute complex workflows \n",
    "3. **Agency** - Enable your LLM to interact with it's environmetn via decision making"

    "1. Components - LangChain makes it easy to swap out abstractions and components necessary to work with language models.\n",
